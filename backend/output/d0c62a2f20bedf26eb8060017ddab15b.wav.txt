 So this chapter will be a bit darker nature apologies for that that it's called drugs as weapons
 So when certain drugs could be used with ill and pence, but also because they're just very very dangerous and and potential poisons
 so a little history capsule to begin with
 chemical chemical weapons over time in ancient Greece
 There is a count of Hercules using hydropoison on arrows being the first account of using chemicals during you know for for
 aggressive purposes, let's say
 But then also a lot of indigenous tribes using karate for example like a paralyzing agent on their arrows and
 Then other forms of that followed of course
 In the early modern era
 Da Vinci was known to have proposed to throw arsenic poison fuse fumes at enemy ships as a potential war strategy
 Then in the 1899 Hagen conference there was a proposal to ban the use of shells filled with
 Asphyating asphyxiating gas that was passed so basically countries decided that during war
 We're trying to kill ourselves
 But we're gonna do it in a like civilized manner because you know it matters when you're dying if it you were killed nicely or
 Improperly the result is much different. I always found that very ironic
 So in war war one
 Country said okay. Yes, but not really about 124
 Thousand tons of mustard gas was produced by the end of the war
 Lustered gas is also known as
 Acculating agents when used in as a anti cancer drug
 You can see that in the chemo therapy lecture
 They were the first anti cancer drugs partly because it was noticed that those in those soldiers exposed to it
 Had lower levels of blood cells. So then it was thought to oh we could treat blood cancers with that and it turns out that it worked
 Then in 1925 after World War one Geneva protocol was ratified at nations vowed to never use chemical gas in warfare again
 Of course right because then we can kill each other with more creative means I guess right because that again is a much more appropriate
 Nobody has thought about just not killing each other at all probably
 World War two no usage
 So it was respected to some extent during combat by allies or Germany
 But then the gas chambers for Jewish Holocaust that you know
 That count technically they weren't soldiers, but you know, are we happy about that result? Of course not
 So once again drugs can be used with very very harmful and ill intent can do a lot of damage
 And then finally post World War two chemical weapons are still in use unfortunately in many places
 especially now more recently in several mid Middle Eastern conflicts
 Recently in the Syrian Civil War
 Saren and mustard gas were also used there's evidence of that so it's still still present to this day just because it's efficient
 I guess so if that's your purpose
 Well, then rationally it makes sense. I guess
 even though
 Should be should be you know part of history by now?
 So let's look at a few example of very poisonous substances to be aware of starting with anthrax might have heard of anthrax before
 It was in the news a couple years ago
 Especially because of scandal in the states that I'll get to on the next slide
 So anthrax is an aerobic gram positive
 Basilized so it's a form of bacteria that can survive for decades as dormant spores
 And it's going to be activated by the presence of nutrients so that then it's going to
 Evolve into its active virulent form it can be transmitted via inhalation so
 Breathing in the spores or cutaneous so exposure on the surface of the skin
 But not from person to person meaning a person infected with anthrax is not continuous to another one
 Right, it's only if the spores are present
 Right they would have to be collected from the person
 So cutaneous anthrax
 Symptoms onset is one to seven days so really quick and it forms a scab like or co-like lesion right that you can see here
 So that's what they call it co-like because they're really really dark and almost solid
 It only becomes life-threatening if the infection becomes systemic
 All right most of the time it's possible to to keep it localized so that it you know
 It doesn't look very nice very very unpleasant, but it at least not life-threatening
 Inhalation anthrax is more concerning the bacterial toxin
 Released internally causes hemorrhage edema and necrosis of respiratory cells
 The time course is a bit longer than cutaneous but much more you know harmful
 So within a week you have some mild initial symptoms it could be passed as like just a cough or a
 Clumb and cold, but then a few days later they become very severe suddenly leading the septisemia so
 So then it becomes more
 systemic
 Respiratory distress is significant and death is
 Inevitable once the toxin reaches a critical level
 Fatali rate is in the 80 percent range, which is huge, right?
 So
 anthrax made the news a lot in 2001 you can read more about it, but basically different letters
 Five letters to be exact with military grade
 anthrax was sent to news media and to
 Democratic senators overall 22 people were affected and five of them died
 So 22 were exposed to it the letters were all written the same it was meant to
 it was passed as a
 Terrorist attack right you see the the person tried to frame
 Muslim individuals by saying that to America that to Israel Allah is great, right?
 But the primary suspect was actually a an American citizen called dr. Irvin's and he was the
 X medical researcher for the US government
 We'll never know for sure right even though there's a lot of evidence pointing in his direction
 Because he died of an acetaminophen overdose in 2008 while being investigated by the FBI for this exact reason so again coincidence
 right
 Probably not or at least there's a lot of
 Circumstantial evidence still but pointing in his direction so and after that, you know
 There's no more trace of who could have been the perpetrators
 So very likely that was him so then people were asking about why like he's an ex medical researcher
 And what was the point he of all people he knew how dangerous anthrax was and how to use it
 Which then some people said well, yeah, there's see that could be a good culprit and one of his motives was that
 He was known to be very angry because the government
 Stopped the anthrax vaccination program with which he was heavily invested
 Because they deemed that it was no longer necessary to vaccinate people against anthrax because the risk of attacks were low
 So what he tried to do at least what we think tried to do is that he created this attack to show people that it's still possible
 For for individuals to to you know use anthrax with evil intent
 But one of the thing is that he had access to anthrax because now the only few bases where he can find anthrax anymore
 Are in military bases and he had access to military bases due to his job
 But most civilians don't have access to that
 So the risks are still fairly low, but the thing is that it worked right since this attack the u.s. government reinstated the anthrax vaccination program
 So it's still up and running so if that was his motive it actually worked
 What would we do all right?
 Let's say someone was to do a more widespread attack with anthrax the best drug we have for it is
 Cyprofloxacin so initiation with antibiotics is
 The best course of action so it's cyprofloxacin
 Amoxicillin is the alternative and the duration is about a two months course if you can initiate IV
 Cypro it's the best
 For individual cases, but if it's a mass casualty imagine if like millions of people were exposed to it in some way
 Well, you can't just plug millions of people on IV lines. So distribution of PO
 Cyprofloxacin would then be better
 There are some monoclonal antibodies and anthrax immunoglobulins that can be given to neutralize the toxin
 This helps to limit damage post infection
 If it's a case of cutaneous anthrax use the same treatments as above it prevents the systemic infection
 But it doesn't prevent the skin lesions because the bacteria is still on the surface of the skin
 Right, it just prevents it from multiplying and reaching other organs, but at least that's not going to be life-threatening
 Okay, so another one to be concerned with is smallpox here's a picture of one of the last cases of smallpox
 It's a disease that was eradicated from the planet in
 1977 thanks to vaccination, right?
 it's one of the big success of vaccination and
 Five years later the vaccination program was stopped when you know
 We're kind of very confident that the disease was not no longer there
 So no need to vaccinate people for a disease that doesn't exist the irony is that this means that no one is protected anymore
 So it would be a perfect bioweapon if someone would evil intent again was able to recreate the virus of smallpox to which we know
 The genetic sequence and things like that so it would be possible to probably recreate it
 Synthetically no one would be protected so it would cause a lot of damage and harm to people before we could react
 Transmission is very contagious person to person so like coughing sneezing can transmit it
 Also possible to be contaminated via clotting and bedding so just sleeping in the same bed as someone who had smallpox you can get it
 most contagious when the skin scabs and the rash phase are present like you can see on the picture there
 Symptoms are include high fever bumpy and fluids filled skin rashes. Their mortality is about 30% which is quite high right?
 So imagine if you had millions of people infected you to get a lot of of that
 Treatment vaccine is the only treatment available to to this day
 Which you know, it's excellent one of the best thing
 But the thing with vaccine is that if if you get infected it becomes a bit too late, right?
 Vaccines work as a prevention
 The thing right now is that we don't do that anymore
 But since 2003 military personnel have a mandatory vaccination against smallpox in case it was used as a weapon
 Right they could be the ones on the front line trying to protect people
 Vaccination is not recommended for civilians at this point. So no need to stop sleeping a night for that the risks are extremely low
 we have some buffer layers between us and
 Risk population and there's new research going on still
 For trying to look for antiviral drugs that could be beneficial against it so that
 We could react even if people were infected and the vaccine was no longer the best option
