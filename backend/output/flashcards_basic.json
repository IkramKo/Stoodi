So the big focus of   this chapter will be really on drugs to reduce acid secretion from the stomach as well as   on the antibiotics that are used when it's a case of ulcers caused by infection with   elicobacter pylori bacteria. So I highly recommend you review your petal fizz. It's   not fresh in your mind because that's really going to help you make the links and understand   why we're using those types of drugs and treatments for conditions like ulcers. Really, what should   be on the top of your mind right now are the processes of acid secretion by parietal cells   from the stomach as well as the pathology mechanisms of stomach and duodenal ulcers.   So here in this table, it's just a summary of all the drugs that are available for management   of ulcers. I've highlighted antibiotics as well as the histamine subtype II receptor   antagonist and the proton pump inhibitors because those are usually, you know, vast   majority of cases, those will be the preferred agents because in many cases it is also produced   by H-pylori infections. So the antibiotics come in handy. And otherwise, even with H-pylori   or not, proton pump inhibitors and histamine antagonists are the two top class of drugs   for anti ulcer options because they are very efficient at reducing the amount of acid being   released in the stomach which contribute to the degradation of the mucosa and the pain   and bleeding associated with ulcers. The other agents I'll discuss very, very quickly,   antacids and sacral fate as kind of like second line options. Misoprostol also exists but it's   usually specific only to the NSAID-induced type of ulcers. So it's not that it doesn't   happen but it has a very specific usage so I'm going to leave it out of the discussion   for this time. So this diagram is perfect to highlight the mechanism of action of all   those classes of drugs. They all share in common that they in some way inhibit the action of   the hydrogen-potassium pump located on the bridal cells that is responsible for dumping   the hydrogen ions to increase the acidity of the stomach's fluid. The only exception   would be the antacids who they don't act in any way on the activity of the pump. They   simply wrap around and prevent hydrogen ions from playing a role in the pH of this environment.   All the others, so we're going to focus a lot on the proton pump inhibitors of course   who directly just inhibit this protein. The other class that is quite efficient are the   histamine and agonist that by blocking this pathway here it greatly decreases the stimulatory effects   of histamine on this hydrogen-potassium pump. So as an overview again just more generally as a   nursing capsule for the treatment of ulcers in terms of drug therapy, first the goal that you know   try to achieve with managing those ulcers is to alleviate the symptoms, try to promote healing   and prevent complications and relapse of future ulcers. For the selection of the different drugs   it depends on the cause. If it's H-pylori-induced then antibiotics must be part of the regimen   usually combined with a proton pump inhibitor or a histamine receptor antagonist. If it's an   NSAID-induced prevention then PPI, so proton pump inhibitors or misoprostol can be given ahead of   time. Let's say you're initiating, a patient is initiating NSAID therapy for rheumatoid arthritis   for example, so higher dosage for a longer period of time. If it's NSAID-induced, so now it's not a   prevention anymore like we know that ulcers are present and have been induced by NSAIDs, then   its proton pump inhibitors will be favored and of course discontinuing the NSAID is pretty   logical. In terms of the evaluation, pain of elevation and ulcer healing often do not correlate.   What that means is that sometimes the patient might still feel pain even though the ulcer is   healing, so you're on the right track but it's still quite painful even if it's less, even if the   ulcer is less large or less important, the bleeding has reduced but the pain could be very very   sensitive still and in other cases pain could be going away while the ulcer is still present in   a sense that some individuals will develop some form of desensitization, they'll become tolerant to   the pain even though the ulcer is still very much present and causing damage to the mucosa   bleeding, internal bleeding, etc. So it's really important to perform H-pyloride tests   whenever you're unsure about the cause or you want to make sure that even if you knew that   H-pyloride was the causative agent you want to make sure if it has been eradicated. You can also   perform radiologic or endoscopic exams to go have a visual on the healing process. In terms of non-drug   therapies, so other things that can help, consuming meals in smaller portions, so 5 to 6 smaller meals   throughout the day rather than 3 large meals can help decrease the stomach acidity fluctuation,   remember from your physiology that acid secretion is stimulated by the presence of a large bolus of   food within the GI tract. So eating smaller portions throughout the day helps to minimize the like   ups and downs in acid secretion which have a bigger effect on the ulcer pathophis. There is no   evidence of so-called ulcer diets on the ulcer pathophis meaning that any diet that claims that   it protects etc has not been proven in the correct scientific inquiry fashion like a double blind   randomized control trial. People on this ulcer diet, people on another diet and then looking at   the difference. None of that has been done or so few that conclusion like that is most likely to   be a marketing tactic than an actual claim. Also exacerbation by coffee and tea, we know that   there are accounts of individuals who drink large quantities of coffee and tea and feeling like   they have ulcers or a lot of pain and that potentially that would be the culprit. The evidence is   kind of there for potentially initiating or at least participating but once you have an ulcer,   it doesn't seem like it's making it much worse in the sense that person probably should not   increase their consumption of coffee or tea that they had at the moment but it doesn't seem like by   stopping their coffee or tea consumption, it's not sufficient to help heal or exacerbate significantly   the ulcers. So it seems to be like a non-significant factor up to that point. So once an ulcer is   there, it seems like coffee or tea doesn't play a role very much after that. Other measures that   are helpful avoid ulcer-inducing agents. So NSAIDs accept low dose aspirin because low dose aspirin   is used for prevention of cardiovascular events. So in those cases, the low dose aspirin,   the benefits outweigh the risks. So in those cases, it's going to be recommended to continue   otherwise discontinuity NSAIDs. Smoking exacerbates ulcers. Anxiety and stress is known to   exacerbate ulcers as well. And alcohol has some debative evidence. It has mostly to do with chronic   intake of alcohol. So if you take a small glass of wine or a beer one evening in your week, it   shouldn't make a difference but if there is a sustained chronic consumption, then it's probably   less more likely to be harmful. So let's not take a chance even though the evidence is debated,   try to go towards the lower end of consumption of alcohol during that time.","3":"Welcome to the recording on the drugs for pectic ulcers chapter.

So if you take a small glass of wine or a beer one evening in your week, it   shouldn't make a difference but if there is a sustained chronic consumption, then it's probably   less more likely to be harmful. So let's not take a chance even though the evidence is debated,   try to go towards the lower end of consumption of alcohol during that time.","6":"Welcome to the recording on the drugs for pectic ulcers chapter. So the big focus of   this chapter will be really on drugs to reduce acid secretion from the stomach as well as   on the antibiotics that are used when it's a case of ulcers caused by infection with   elicobacter pylori bacteria. So I highly recommend you review your petal fizz. It's   not fresh in your mind because that's really going to help you make the links and understand   why we're using those types of drugs and treatments for conditions like ulcers. Really, what should   be on the top of your mind right now are the processes of acid secretion by parietal cells   from the stomach as well as the pathology mechanisms of stomach and duodenal ulcers.   So here in this table, it's just a summary of all the drugs that are available for management   of ulcers. I've highlighted antibiotics as well as the histamine subtype II receptor   antagonist and the proton pump inhibitors because those are usually, you know, vast   majority of cases, those will be the preferred agents because in many cases it is also produced   by H-pylori infections. So the antibiotics come in handy. And otherwise, even with H-pylori   or not, proton pump inhibitors and histamine antagonists are the two top class of drugs   for anti ulcer options because they are very efficient at reducing the amount of acid being   released in the stomach which contribute to the degradation of the mucosa and the pain   and bleeding associated with ulcers. The other agents I'll discuss very, very quickly,   antacids and sacral fate as kind of like second line options. Misoprostol also exists but it's   usually specific only to the NSAID-induced type of ulcers. So it's not that it doesn't   happen but it has a very specific usage so I'm going to leave it out of the discussion   for this time. So this diagram is perfect to highlight the mechanism of action of all   those classes of drugs. They all share in common that they in some way inhibit the action of   the hydrogen-potassium pump located on the bridal cells that is responsible for dumping   the hydrogen ions to increase the acidity of the stomach's fluid. The only exception   would be the antacids who they don't act in any way on the activity of the pump. They   simply wrap around and prevent hydrogen ions from playing a role in the pH of this environment.   All the others, so we're going to focus a lot on the proton pump inhibitors of course   who directly just inhibit this protein. The other class that is quite efficient are the   histamine and agonist that by blocking this pathway here it greatly decreases the stimulatory effects   of histamine on this hydrogen-potassium pump. So as an overview again just more generally as a   nursing capsule for the treatment of ulcers in terms of drug therapy, first the goal that you know   try to achieve with managing those ulcers is to alleviate the symptoms, try to promote healing   and prevent complications and relapse of future ulcers. For the selection of the different drugs   it depends on the cause. If it's H-pylori-induced then antibiotics must be part of the regimen   usually combined with a proton pump inhibitor or a histamine receptor antagonist. If it's an   NSAID-induced prevention then PPI, so proton pump inhibitors or misoprostol can be given ahead of   time. Let's say you're initiating, a patient is initiating NSAID therapy for rheumatoid arthritis   for example, so higher dosage for a longer period of time. If it's NSAID-induced, so now it's not a   prevention anymore like we know that ulcers are present and have been induced by NSAIDs, then   its proton pump inhibitors will be favored and of course discontinuing the NSAID is pretty   logical. In terms of the evaluation, pain of elevation and ulcer healing often do not correlate.   What that means is that sometimes the patient might still feel pain even though the ulcer is   healing, so you're on the right track but it's still quite painful even if it's less, even if the   ulcer is less large or less important, the bleeding has reduced but the pain could be very very   sensitive still and in other cases pain could be going away while the ulcer is still present in   a sense that some individuals will develop some form of desensitization, they'll become tolerant to   the pain even though the ulcer is still very much present and causing damage to the mucosa   bleeding, internal bleeding, etc. So it's really important to perform H-pyloride tests   whenever you're unsure about the cause or you want to make sure that even if you knew that   H-pyloride was the causative agent you want to make sure if it has been eradicated. You can also   perform radiologic or endoscopic exams to go have a visual on the healing process. In terms of non-drug   therapies, so other things that can help, consuming meals in smaller portions, so 5 to 6 smaller meals   throughout the day rather than 3 large meals can help decrease the stomach acidity fluctuation,   remember from your physiology that acid secretion is stimulated by the presence of a large bolus of   food within the GI tract. So eating smaller portions throughout the day helps to minimize the like   ups and downs in acid secretion which have a bigger effect on the ulcer pathophis. There is no   evidence of so-called ulcer diets on the ulcer pathophis meaning that any diet that claims that   it protects etc has not been proven in the correct scientific inquiry fashion like a double blind   randomized control trial. People on this ulcer diet, people on another diet and then looking at   the difference. None of that has been done or so few that conclusion like that is most likely to   be a marketing tactic than an actual claim. Also exacerbation by coffee and tea, we know that   there are accounts of individuals who drink large quantities of coffee and tea and feeling like   they have ulcers or a lot of pain and that potentially that would be the culprit. The evidence is   kind of there for potentially initiating or at least participating but once you have an ulcer,   it doesn't seem like it's making it much worse in the sense that person probably should not   increase their consumption of coffee or tea that they had at the moment but it doesn't seem like by   stopping their coffee or tea consumption, it's not sufficient to help heal or exacerbate significantly   the ulcers. So it seems to be like a non-significant factor up to that point. So once an ulcer is   there, it seems like coffee or tea doesn't play a role very much after that. Other measures that   are helpful avoid ulcer-inducing agents. So NSAIDs accept low dose aspirin because low dose aspirin   is used for prevention of cardiovascular events. So in those cases, the low dose aspirin,   the benefits outweigh the risks. So in those cases, it's going to be recommended to continue   otherwise discontinuity NSAIDs. Smoking exacerbates ulcers. Anxiety and stress is known to   exacerbate ulcers as well. And alcohol has some debative evidence. It has mostly to do with chronic   intake of alcohol.

What that means is that sometimes the patient might still feel pain even though the ulcer is   healing, so you're on the right track but it's still quite painful even if it's less, even if the   ulcer is less large or less important, the bleeding has reduced but the pain could be very very   sensitive still and in other cases pain could be going away while the ulcer is still present in   a sense that some individuals will develop some form of desensitization, they'll become tolerant to   the pain even though the ulcer is still very much present and causing damage to the mucosa   bleeding, internal bleeding, etc. So it's really important to perform H-pyloride tests   whenever you're unsure about the cause or you want to make sure that even if you knew that   H-pyloride was the causative agent you want to make sure if it has been eradicated. You can also   perform radiologic or endoscopic exams to go have a visual on the healing process. In terms of non-drug   therapies, so other things that can help, consuming meals in smaller portions, so 5 to 6 smaller meals   throughout the day rather than 3 large meals can help decrease the stomach acidity fluctuation,   remember from your physiology that acid secretion is stimulated by the presence of a large bolus of   food within the GI tract. So eating smaller portions throughout the day helps to minimize the like   ups and downs in acid secretion which have a bigger effect on the ulcer pathophis. There is no   evidence of so-called ulcer diets on the ulcer pathophis meaning that any diet that claims that   it protects etc has not been proven in the correct scientific inquiry fashion like a double blind   randomized control trial. People on this ulcer diet, people on another diet and then looking at   the difference. None of that has been done or so few that conclusion like that is most likely to   be a marketing tactic than an actual claim. Also exacerbation by coffee and tea, we know that   there are accounts of individuals who drink large quantities of coffee and tea and feeling like   they have ulcers or a lot of pain and that potentially that would be the culprit. The evidence is   kind of there for potentially initiating or at least participating but once you have an ulcer,   it doesn't seem like it's making it much worse in the sense that person probably should not   increase their consumption of coffee or tea that they had at the moment but it doesn't seem like by   stopping their coffee or tea consumption, it's not sufficient to help heal or exacerbate significantly   the ulcers. So it seems to be like a non-significant factor up to that point. So once an ulcer is   there, it seems like coffee or tea doesn't play a role very much after that. Other measures that   are helpful avoid ulcer-inducing agents. So NSAIDs accept low dose aspirin because low dose aspirin   is used for prevention of cardiovascular events. So in those cases, the low dose aspirin,   the benefits outweigh the risks. So in those cases, it's going to be recommended to continue   otherwise discontinuity NSAIDs. Smoking exacerbates ulcers. Anxiety and stress is known to   exacerbate ulcers as well. And alcohol has some debative evidence. It has mostly to do with chronic   intake of alcohol. So if you take a small glass of wine or a beer one evening in your week, it   shouldn't make a difference but if there is a sustained chronic consumption, then it's probably   less more likely to be harmful. So let's not take a chance even though the evidence is debated,   try to go towards the lower end of consumption of alcohol during that time.","11":"Welcome to the recording on the drugs for pectic ulcers chapter. So the big focus of   this chapter will be really on drugs to reduce acid secretion from the stomach as well as   on the antibiotics that are used when it's a case of ulcers caused by infection with   elicobacter pylori bacteria. So I highly recommend you review your petal fizz. It's   not fresh in your mind because that's really going to help you make the links and understand   why we're using those types of drugs and treatments for conditions like ulcers. Really, what should   be on the top of your mind right now are the processes of acid secretion by parietal cells   from the stomach as well as the pathology mechanisms of stomach and duodenal ulcers.   So here in this table, it's just a summary of all the drugs that are available for management   of ulcers. I've highlighted antibiotics as well as the histamine subtype II receptor   antagonist and the proton pump inhibitors because those are usually, you know, vast   majority of cases, those will be the preferred agents because in many cases it is also produced   by H-pylori infections. So the antibiotics come in handy. And otherwise, even with H-pylori   or not, proton pump inhibitors and histamine antagonists are the two top class of drugs   for anti ulcer options because they are very efficient at reducing the amount of acid being   released in the stomach which contribute to the degradation of the mucosa and the pain   and bleeding associated with ulcers. The other agents I'll discuss very, very quickly,   antacids and sacral fate as kind of like second line options. Misoprostol also exists but it's   usually specific only to the NSAID-induced type of ulcers. So it's not that it doesn't   happen but it has a very specific usage so I'm going to leave it out of the discussion   for this time. So this diagram is perfect to highlight the mechanism of action of all   those classes of drugs. They all share in common that they in some way inhibit the action of   the hydrogen-potassium pump located on the bridal cells that is responsible for dumping   the hydrogen ions to increase the acidity of the stomach's fluid. The only exception   would be the antacids who they don't act in any way on the activity of the pump. They   simply wrap around and prevent hydrogen ions from playing a role in the pH of this environment.   All the others, so we're going to focus a lot on the proton pump inhibitors of course   who directly just inhibit this protein. The other class that is quite efficient are the   histamine and agonist that by blocking this pathway here it greatly decreases the stimulatory effects   of histamine on this hydrogen-potassium pump. So as an overview again just more generally as a   nursing capsule for the treatment of ulcers in terms of drug therapy, first the goal that you know   try to achieve with managing those ulcers is to alleviate the symptoms, try to promote healing   and prevent complications and relapse of future ulcers. For the selection of the different drugs   it depends on the cause. If it's H-pylori-induced then antibiotics must be part of the regimen   usually combined with a proton pump inhibitor or a histamine receptor antagonist. If it's an   NSAID-induced prevention then PPI, so proton pump inhibitors or misoprostol can be given ahead of   time. Let's say you're initiating, a patient is initiating NSAID therapy for rheumatoid arthritis   for example, so higher dosage for a longer period of time. If it's NSAID-induced, so now it's not a   prevention anymore like we know that ulcers are present and have been induced by NSAIDs, then   its proton pump inhibitors will be favored and of course discontinuing the NSAID is pretty   logical.

The other agents I'll discuss very, very quickly,   antacids and sacral fate as kind of like second line options. Misoprostol also exists but it's   usually specific only to the NSAID-induced type of ulcers. So it's not that it doesn't   happen but it has a very specific usage so I'm going to leave it out of the discussion   for this time. So this diagram is perfect to highlight the mechanism of action of all   those classes of drugs. They all share in common that they in some way inhibit the action of   the hydrogen-potassium pump located on the bridal cells that is responsible for dumping   the hydrogen ions to increase the acidity of the stomach's fluid. The only exception   would be the antacids who they don't act in any way on the activity of the pump. They   simply wrap around and prevent hydrogen ions from playing a role in the pH of this environment.   All the others, so we're going to focus a lot on the proton pump inhibitors of course   who directly just inhibit this protein. The other class that is quite efficient are the   histamine and agonist that by blocking this pathway here it greatly decreases the stimulatory effects   of histamine on this hydrogen-potassium pump. So as an overview again just more generally as a   nursing capsule for the treatment of ulcers in terms of drug therapy, first the goal that you know   try to achieve with managing those ulcers is to alleviate the symptoms, try to promote healing   and prevent complications and relapse of future ulcers. For the selection of the different drugs   it depends on the cause. If it's H-pylori-induced then antibiotics must be part of the regimen   usually combined with a proton pump inhibitor or a histamine receptor antagonist. If it's an   NSAID-induced prevention then PPI, so proton pump inhibitors or misoprostol can be given ahead of   time. Let's say you're initiating, a patient is initiating NSAID therapy for rheumatoid arthritis   for example, so higher dosage for a longer period of time. If it's NSAID-induced, so now it's not a   prevention anymore like we know that ulcers are present and have been induced by NSAIDs, then   its proton pump inhibitors will be favored and of course discontinuing the NSAID is pretty   logical. In terms of the evaluation, pain of elevation and ulcer healing often do not correlate.   What that means is that sometimes the patient might still feel pain even though the ulcer is   healing, so you're on the right track but it's still quite painful even if it's less, even if the   ulcer is less large or less important, the bleeding has reduced but the pain could be very very   sensitive still and in other cases pain could be going away while the ulcer is still present in   a sense that some individuals will develop some form of desensitization, they'll become tolerant to   the pain even though the ulcer is still very much present and causing damage to the mucosa   bleeding, internal bleeding, etc. So it's really important to perform H-pyloride tests   whenever you're unsure about the cause or you want to make sure that even if you knew that   H-pyloride was the causative agent you want to make sure if it has been eradicated. You can also   perform radiologic or endoscopic exams to go have a visual on the healing process. In terms of non-drug   therapies, so other things that can help, consuming meals in smaller portions, so 5 to 6 smaller meals   throughout the day rather than 3 large meals can help decrease the stomach acidity fluctuation,   remember from your physiology that acid secretion is stimulated by the presence of a large bolus of   food within the GI tract. So eating smaller portions throughout the day helps to minimize the like   ups and downs in acid secretion which have a bigger effect on the ulcer pathophis. There is no   evidence of so-called ulcer diets on the ulcer pathophis meaning that any diet that claims that   it protects etc has not been proven in the correct scientific inquiry fashion like a double blind   randomized control trial. People on this ulcer diet, people on another diet and then looking at   the difference. None of that has been done or so few that conclusion like that is most likely to   be a marketing tactic than an actual claim. Also exacerbation by coffee and tea, we know that   there are accounts of individuals who drink large quantities of coffee and tea and feeling like   they have ulcers or a lot of pain and that potentially that would be the culprit. The evidence is   kind of there for potentially initiating or at least participating but once you have an ulcer,   it doesn't seem like it's making it much worse in the sense that person probably should not   increase their consumption of coffee or tea that they had at the moment but it doesn't seem like by   stopping their coffee or tea consumption, it's not sufficient to help heal or exacerbate significantly   the ulcers. So it seems to be like a non-significant factor up to that point. So once an ulcer is   there, it seems like coffee or tea doesn't play a role very much after that. Other measures that   are helpful avoid ulcer-inducing agents. So NSAIDs accept low dose aspirin because low dose aspirin   is used for prevention of cardiovascular events. So in those cases, the low dose aspirin,   the benefits outweigh the risks. So in those cases, it's going to be recommended to continue   otherwise discontinuity NSAIDs. Smoking exacerbates ulcers. Anxiety and stress is known to   exacerbate ulcers as well. And alcohol has some debative evidence. It has mostly to do with chronic   intake of alcohol. So if you take a small glass of wine or a beer one evening in your week, it   shouldn't make a difference but if there is a sustained chronic consumption, then it's probably   less more likely to be harmful. So let's not take a chance even though the evidence is debated,   try to go towards the lower end of consumption of alcohol during that time."},"combined_columns":{"2":"###############Combined columns:<br>\nCLOZE: <br>\nNOTE_TYPE: basic<br>\nQUESTION: What chapter will be focused on drugs to reduce acid secretion from the stomach?<br>\nANSWER: drugs for pectic ulcers<br>\nBASIC_IN_CLOZED_FORMAT: What chapter will be focused on drugs to reduce acid secretion from the stomach?<br>{{c1::drugs for pectic ulcers}}<br>\nDATE: Sun Feb  5 14:47:29 2023<br>\nSOURCE_TITLE: untitled variable<br>\nSOURCE_TEXT: Welcome to the recording on the drugs for pectic ulcers chapter.

So I highly recommend you review your petal fizz.

What that means is that sometimes the patient might still feel pain even though the ulcer is   healing, so you're on the right track but it's still quite painful even if it's less, even if the   ulcer is less large or less important, the bleeding has reduced but the pain could be very very   sensitive still and in other cases pain could be going away while the ulcer is still present in   a sense that some individuals will develop some form of desensitization, they'll become tolerant to   the pain even though the ulcer is still very much present and causing damage to the mucosa   bleeding, internal bleeding, etc. So it's really important to perform H-pyloride tests   whenever you're unsure about the cause or you want to make sure that even if you knew that   H-pyloride was the causative agent you want to make sure if it has been eradicated. You can also   perform radiologic or endoscopic exams to go have a visual on the healing process. In terms of non-drug   therapies, so other things that can help, consuming meals in smaller portions, so 5 to 6 smaller meals   throughout the day rather than 3 large meals can help decrease the stomach acidity fluctuation,   remember from your physiology that acid secretion is stimulated by the presence of a large bolus of   food within the GI tract. So eating smaller portions throughout the day helps to minimize the like   ups and downs in acid secretion which have a bigger effect on the ulcer pathophis. There is no   evidence of so-called ulcer diets on the ulcer pathophis meaning that any diet that claims that   it protects etc has not been proven in the correct scientific inquiry fashion like a double blind   randomized control trial. People on this ulcer diet, people on another diet and then looking at   the difference. None of that has been done or so few that conclusion like that is most likely to   be a marketing tactic than an actual claim. Also exacerbation by coffee and tea, we know that   there are accounts of individuals who drink large quantities of coffee and tea and feeling like   they have ulcers or a lot of pain and that potentially that would be the culprit. The evidence is   kind of there for potentially initiating or at least participating but once you have an ulcer,   it doesn't seem like it's making it much worse in the sense that person probably should not   increase their consumption of coffee or tea that they had at the moment but it doesn't seem like by   stopping their coffee or tea consumption, it's not sufficient to help heal or exacerbate significantly   the ulcers. So it seems to be like a non-significant factor up to that point. So once an ulcer is   there, it seems like coffee or tea doesn't play a role very much after that. Other measures that   are helpful avoid ulcer-inducing agents. So NSAIDs accept low dose aspirin because low dose aspirin   is used for prevention of cardiovascular events. So in those cases, the low dose aspirin,   the benefits outweigh the risks. So in those cases, it's going to be recommended to continue   otherwise discontinuity NSAIDs. Smoking exacerbates ulcers. Anxiety and stress is known to   exacerbate ulcers as well. And alcohol has some debative evidence. It has mostly to do with chronic   intake of alcohol. So if you take a small glass of wine or a beer one evening in your week, it   shouldn't make a difference but if there is a sustained chronic consumption, then it's probably   less more likely to be harmful. So let's not take a chance even though the evidence is debated,   try to go towards the lower end of consumption of alcohol during that time.<br>\n###############","6":"###############Combined columns:<br>\nCLOZE: <br>\nNOTE_TYPE: basic<br>\nQUESTION: What is the table that contains the drugs for pectic ulcers?<br>\nANSWER: a summary of all the drugs that are available for management of ulcers<br>\nBASIC_IN_CLOZED_FORMAT: What is the table that contains the drugs for pectic ulcers?<br>{{c1::a summary of all the drugs that are available for management of ulcers}}<br>\nDATE: Sun Feb  5 14:47:29 2023<br>\nSOURCE_TITLE: untitled variable<br>\nSOURCE_TEXT: Welcome to the recording on the drugs for pectic ulcers chapter. So the big focus of   this chapter will be really on drugs to reduce acid secretion from the stomach as well as   on the antibiotics that are used when it's a case of ulcers caused by infection with   elicobacter pylori bacteria. So I highly recommend you review your petal fizz. It's   not fresh in your mind because that's really going to help you make the links and understand   why we're using those types of drugs and treatments for conditions like ulcers. Really, what should   be on the top of your mind right now are the processes of acid secretion by parietal cells   from the stomach as well as the pathology mechanisms of stomach and duodenal ulcers.   So here in this table, it's just a summary of all the drugs that are available for management   of ulcers. I've highlighted antibiotics as well as the histamine subtype II receptor   antagonist and the proton pump inhibitors because those are usually, you know, vast   majority of cases, those will be the preferred agents because in many cases it is also produced   by H-pylori infections. So the antibiotics come in handy. And otherwise, even with H-pylori   or not, proton pump inhibitors and histamine antagonists are the two top class of drugs   for anti ulcer options because they are very efficient at reducing the amount of acid being   released in the stomach which contribute to the degradation of the mucosa and the pain   and bleeding associated with ulcers. The other agents I'll discuss very, very quickly,   antacids and sacral fate as kind of like second line options. Misoprostol also exists but it's   usually specific only to the NSAID-induced type of ulcers. So it's not that it doesn't   happen but it has a very specific usage so I'm going to leave it out of the discussion   for this time. So this diagram is perfect to highlight the mechanism of action of all   those classes of drugs. They all share in common that they in some way inhibit the action of   the hydrogen-potassium pump located on the bridal cells that is responsible for dumping   the hydrogen ions to increase the acidity of the stomach's fluid. The only exception   would be the antacids who they don't act in any way on the activity of the pump. They   simply wrap around and prevent hydrogen ions from playing a role in the pH of this environment.   All the others, so we're going to focus a lot on the proton pump inhibitors of course   who directly just inhibit this protein. The other class that is quite efficient are the   histamine and agonist that by blocking this pathway here it greatly decreases the stimulatory effects   of histamine on this hydrogen-potassium pump. So as an overview again just more generally as a   nursing capsule for the treatment of ulcers in terms of drug therapy, first the goal that you know   try to achieve with managing those ulcers is to alleviate the symptoms, try to promote healing   and prevent complications and relapse of future ulcers. For the selection of the different drugs   it depends on the cause. If it's H-pylori-induced then antibiotics must be part of the regimen   usually combined with a proton pump inhibitor or a histamine receptor antagonist. If it's an   NSAID-induced prevention then PPI, so proton pump inhibitors or misoprostol can be given ahead of   time. Let's say you're initiating, a patient is initiating NSAID therapy for rheumatoid arthritis   for example, so higher dosage for a longer period of time. If it's NSAID-induced, so now it's not a   prevention anymore like we know that ulcers are present and have been induced by NSAIDs, then   its proton pump inhibitors will be favored and of course discontinuing the NSAID is pretty   logical.

So it seems to be like a non-significant factor up to that point. So once an ulcer is   there, it seems like coffee or tea doesn't play a role very much after that. Other measures that   are helpful avoid ulcer-inducing agents. So NSAIDs accept low dose aspirin because low dose aspirin   is used for prevention of cardiovascular events. So in those cases, the low dose aspirin,   the benefits outweigh the risks. So in those cases, it's going to be recommended to continue   otherwise discontinuity NSAIDs. Smoking exacerbates ulcers. Anxiety and stress is known to   exacerbate ulcers as well. And alcohol has some debative evidence. It has mostly to do with chronic   intake of alcohol. So if you take a small glass of wine or a beer one evening in your week, it   shouldn't make a difference but if there is a sustained chronic consumption, then it's probably   less more likely to be harmful. So let's not take a chance even though the evidence is debated,   try to go towards the lower end of consumption of alcohol during that time.<br>\n###############","10":"###############Combined columns:<br>\nCLOZE: <br>\nNOTE_TYPE: basic<br>\nQUESTION: What are two other drugs that are used for ulcers?<br>\nANSWER: antacids and sacral fate<br>\nBASIC_IN_CLOZED_FORMAT: What are two other drugs that are used for ulcers?<br>{{c1::antacids and sacral fate}}<br>\nDATE: Sun Feb  5 14:47:29 2023<br>\nSOURCE_TITLE: untitled variable<br>\nSOURCE_TEXT: Welcome to the recording on the drugs for pectic ulcers chapter. So the big focus of   this chapter will be really on drugs to reduce acid secretion from the stomach as well as   on the antibiotics that are used when it's a case of ulcers caused by infection with   elicobacter pylori bacteria. So I highly recommend you review your petal fizz. It's   not fresh in your mind because that's really going to help you make the links and understand   why we're using those types of drugs and treatments for conditions like ulcers. Really, what should   be on the top of your mind right now are the processes of acid secretion by parietal cells   from the stomach as well as the pathology mechanisms of stomach and duodenal ulcers.   So here in this table, it's just a summary of all the drugs that are available for management   of ulcers. I've highlighted antibiotics as well as the histamine subtype II receptor   antagonist and the proton pump inhibitors because those are usually, you know, vast   majority of cases, those will be the preferred agents because in many cases it is also produced   by H-pylori infections. So the antibiotics come in handy. And otherwise, even with H-pylori   or not, proton pump inhibitors and histamine antagonists are the two top class of drugs   for anti ulcer options because they are very efficient at reducing the amount of acid being   released in the stomach which contribute to the degradation of the mucosa and the pain   and bleeding associated with ulcers. The other agents I'll discuss very, very quickly,   antacids and sacral fate as kind of like second line options. Misoprostol also exists but it's   usually specific only to the NSAID-induced type of ulcers. So it's not that it doesn't   happen but it has a very specific usage so I'm going to leave it out of the discussion   for this time. So this diagram is perfect to highlight the mechanism of action of all   those classes of drugs. They all share in common that they in some way inhibit the action of   the hydrogen-potassium pump located on the bridal cells that is responsible for dumping   the hydrogen ions to increase the acidity of the stomach's fluid. The only exception   would be the antacids who they don't act in any way on the activity of the pump. They   simply wrap around and prevent hydrogen ions from playing a role in the pH of this environment.   All the others, so we're going to focus a lot on the proton pump inhibitors of course   who directly just inhibit this protein. The other class that is quite efficient are the   histamine and agonist that by blocking this pathway here it greatly decreases the stimulatory effects   of histamine on this hydrogen-potassium pump. So as an overview again just more generally as a   nursing capsule for the treatment of ulcers in terms of drug therapy, first the goal that you know   try to achieve with managing those ulcers is to alleviate the symptoms, try to promote healing   and prevent complications and relapse of future ulcers. For the selection of the different drugs   it depends on the cause. If it's H-pylori-induced then antibiotics must be part of the regimen   usually combined with a proton pump inhibitor or a histamine receptor antagonist. If it's an   NSAID-induced prevention then PPI, so proton pump inhibitors or misoprostol can be given ahead of   time. Let's say you're initiating, a patient is initiating NSAID therapy for rheumatoid arthritis   for example, so higher dosage for a longer period of time. If it's NSAID-induced, so now it's not a   prevention anymore like we know that ulcers are present and have been induced by NSAIDs, then   its proton pump inhibitors will be favored and of course discontinuing the NSAID is pretty   logical. In terms of the evaluation, pain of elevation and ulcer healing often do not correlate.   What that means is that sometimes the patient might still feel pain even though the ulcer is   healing, so you're on the right track but it's still quite painful even if it's less, even if the   ulcer is less large or less important, the bleeding has reduced but the pain could be very very   sensitive still and in other cases pain could be going away while the ulcer is still present in   a sense that some individuals will develop some form of desensitization, they'll become tolerant to   the pain even though the ulcer is still very much present and causing damage to the mucosa   bleeding, internal bleeding, etc. So it's really important to perform H-pyloride tests   whenever you're unsure about the cause or you want to make sure that even if you knew that   H-pyloride was the causative agent you want to make sure if it has been eradicated. You can also   perform radiologic or endoscopic exams to go have a visual on the healing process. In terms of non-drug   therapies, so other things that can help, consuming meals in smaller portions, so 5 to 6 smaller meals   throughout the day rather than 3 large meals can help decrease the stomach acidity fluctuation,   remember from your physiology that acid secretion is stimulated by the presence of a large bolus of   food within the GI tract. So eating smaller portions throughout the day helps to minimize the like   ups and downs in acid secretion which have a bigger effect on the ulcer pathophis. There is no   evidence of so-called ulcer diets on the ulcer pathophis meaning that any diet that claims that   it protects etc has not been proven in the correct scientific inquiry fashion like a double blind   randomized control trial. People on this ulcer diet, people on another diet and then looking at   the difference. None of that has been done or so few that conclusion like that is most likely to   be a marketing tactic than an actual claim. Also exacerbation by coffee and tea, we know that   there are accounts of individuals who drink large quantities of coffee and tea and feeling like   they have ulcers or a lot of pain and that potentially that would be the culprit.

Really, what should   be on the top of your mind right now are the processes of acid secretion by parietal cells   from the stomach as well as the pathology mechanisms of stomach and duodenal ulcers.   So here in this table, it's just a summary of all the drugs that are available for management   of ulcers. I've highlighted antibiotics as well as the histamine subtype II receptor   antagonist and the proton pump inhibitors because those are usually, you know, vast   majority of cases, those will be the preferred agents because in many cases it is also produced   by H-pylori infections. So the antibiotics come in handy. And otherwise, even with H-pylori   or not, proton pump inhibitors and histamine antagonists are the two top class of drugs   for anti ulcer options because they are very efficient at reducing the amount of acid being   released in the stomach which contribute to the degradation of the mucosa and the pain   and bleeding associated with ulcers. The other agents I'll discuss very, very quickly,   antacids and sacral fate as kind of like second line options. Misoprostol also exists but it's   usually specific only to the NSAID-induced type of ulcers. So it's not that it doesn't   happen but it has a very specific usage so I'm going to leave it out of the discussion   for this time. So this diagram is perfect to highlight the mechanism of action of all   those classes of drugs. They all share in common that they in some way inhibit the action of   the hydrogen-potassium pump located on the bridal cells that is responsible for dumping   the hydrogen ions to increase the acidity of the stomach's fluid. The only exception   would be the antacids who they don't act in any way on the activity of the pump. They   simply wrap around and prevent hydrogen ions from playing a role in the pH of this environment.   All the others, so we're going to focus a lot on the proton pump inhibitors of course   who directly just inhibit this protein. The other class that is quite efficient are the   histamine and agonist that by blocking this pathway here it greatly decreases the stimulatory effects   of histamine on this hydrogen-potassium pump. So as an overview again just more generally as a   nursing capsule for the treatment of ulcers in terms of drug therapy, first the goal that you know   try to achieve with managing those ulcers is to alleviate the symptoms, try to promote healing   and prevent complications and relapse of future ulcers. For the selection of the different drugs   it depends on the cause. If it's H-pylori-induced then antibiotics must be part of the regimen   usually combined with a proton pump inhibitor or a histamine receptor antagonist. If it's an   NSAID-induced prevention then PPI, so proton pump inhibitors or misoprostol can be given ahead of   time. Let's say you're initiating, a patient is initiating NSAID therapy for rheumatoid arthritis   for example, so higher dosage for a longer period of time. If it's NSAID-induced, so now it's not a   prevention anymore like we know that ulcers are present and have been induced by NSAIDs, then   its proton pump inhibitors will be favored and of course discontinuing the NSAID is pretty   logical. In terms of the evaluation, pain of elevation and ulcer healing often do not correlate.   What that means is that sometimes the patient might still feel pain even though the ulcer is   healing, so you're on the right track but it's still quite painful even if it's less, even if the   ulcer is less large or less important, the bleeding has reduced but the pain could be very very   sensitive still and in other cases pain could be going away while the ulcer is still present in   a sense that some individuals will develop some form of desensitization, they'll become tolerant to   the pain even though the ulcer is still very much present and causing damage to the mucosa   bleeding, internal bleeding, etc. So it's really important to perform H-pyloride tests   whenever you're unsure about the cause or you want to make sure that even if you knew that   H-pyloride was the causative agent you want to make sure if it has been eradicated. You can also   perform radiologic or endoscopic exams to go have a visual on the healing process. In terms of non-drug   therapies, so other things that can help, consuming meals in smaller portions, so 5 to 6 smaller meals   throughout the day rather than 3 large meals can help decrease the stomach acidity fluctuation,   remember from your physiology that acid secretion is stimulated by the presence of a large bolus of   food within the GI tract. So eating smaller portions throughout the day helps to minimize the like   ups and downs in acid secretion which have a bigger effect on the ulcer pathophis. There is no   evidence of so-called ulcer diets on the ulcer pathophis meaning that any diet that claims that   it protects etc has not been proven in the correct scientific inquiry fashion like a double blind   randomized control trial. People on this ulcer diet, people on another diet and then looking at   the difference. None of that has been done or so few that conclusion like that is most likely to   be a marketing tactic than an actual claim. Also exacerbation by coffee and tea, we know that   there are accounts of individuals who drink large quantities of coffee and tea and feeling like   they have ulcers or a lot of pain and that potentially that would be the culprit. The evidence is   kind of there for potentially initiating or at least participating but once you have an ulcer,   it doesn't seem like it's making it much worse in the sense that person probably should not   increase their consumption of coffee or tea that they had at the moment but it doesn't seem like by   stopping their coffee or tea consumption, it's not sufficient to help heal or exacerbate significantly   the ulcers. So it seems to be like a non-significant factor up to that point. So once an ulcer is   there, it seems like coffee or tea doesn't play a role very much after that. Other measures that   are helpful avoid ulcer-inducing agents. So NSAIDs accept low dose aspirin because low dose aspirin   is used for prevention of cardiovascular events. So in those cases, the low dose aspirin,   the benefits outweigh the risks. So in those cases, it's going to be recommended to continue   otherwise discontinuity NSAIDs. Smoking exacerbates ulcers. Anxiety and stress is known to   exacerbate ulcers as well. And alcohol has some debative evidence. It has mostly to do with chronic   intake of alcohol. So if you take a small glass of wine or a beer one evening in your week, it   shouldn't make a difference but if there is a sustained chronic consumption, then it's probably   less more likely to be harmful. So let's not take a chance even though the evidence is debated,   try to go towards the lower end of consumption of alcohol during that time.<br>\n###############","15":"###############Combined columns:<br>\nCLOZE: <br>\nNOTE_TYPE: basic<br>\nQUESTION: What is the only exception to antacids?<br>\nANSWER: antacid<br>\nBASIC_IN_CLOZED_FORMAT: What is the only exception to antacids?<br>{{c1::antacid}}<br>\nDATE: Sun Feb  5 14:47:29 2023<br>\nSOURCE_TITLE: untitled variable<br>\nSOURCE_TEXT: Welcome to the recording on the drugs for pectic ulcers chapter. So the big focus of   this chapter will be really on drugs to reduce acid secretion from the stomach as well as   on the antibiotics that are used when it's a case of ulcers caused by infection with   elicobacter pylori bacteria.
